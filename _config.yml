  Curiously exploring the world with Python and SQL.

  I'm Sherry, and I am a Data Scientist with a background in business operations. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed streamlining processes in everything that I do. I built an Anime Recommender using content-based and collaborative filter based techniques, in order to make finding my next anime faster. The application gathered over 4500 impressions within a week of posting on LinkedIn. I have an insatiable sense of curiosity- and I use Data Science to answer my many questions. For an example: Did the opening of The Chase Center Stadium lead to an increase in crime in my beloved Dogpatch neighborhood?
